    Placeholder for the RAG Evaluation Harness.

    The QA Agent's task is to build this out to:
    1. Load a "golden set" of questions and expected answers from `data/golden_set`.
    2. Call the local API's /query endpoint for each question.
    3. Compare the generated answer and its citations against the golden answer.
    4. Calculate key RAG metrics (e.g., Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy, Context Precision).
    5. Print a report of the metrics.
    6. Exit with status code 0 if all metrics are above the threshold, else exit with 1.
